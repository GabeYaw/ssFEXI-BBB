This is a repo implementing a self-supervised neural network to the FEXI model of the BBB.
I am making it public so my code is accessable for those marking my 3rd year project, but it is not documented.

This repo is substantially based on MATLAB code from my supervisors Dr. Elizabeth Powell and Snigdha Sen (https://github.com/snigdha-sen/ssverdict), which in turn is based on the deep_ivim repo (https://github.com/sebbarb/deep_ivim/).
