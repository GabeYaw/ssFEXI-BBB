This is a repo implementing a self-supervised neural network to the FEXI model of the BBB.
I am making it public so my code is accessable for those marking my 3rd year project, but it is not documented.

This repo is substantially based on MATLAB code from my supervisors Dr. Elizabeth Powell and Snigdha Sen (https://github.com/snigdha-sen/ssverdict), which in turn is based on the deep_ivim repo (https://github.com/sebbarb/deep_ivim/).

Create and activate a virtual environment (eg: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.

You can run and plot the NLLS and NN estimates from NLLS_plots.py and NN_plots.py respectively. (Run NLLS and NN to not display them.)
